Project Steps:

1)
Re-Create as much of Numpy in C++, but with custom inputs due to the 
inability of Python like argument parsing as of this point in time
using only the CPU to make computation easier to code.

2) 
Integrate CUDA support into the program to ensure that it works properly.

3)
Make the code able to be run in Python to allow for easy usage

4)
Start implementing Machine Learning methods into the code.
